bosque.py contains a forest simulation, in wich 0 represents empty area, 1 represents a tree, and -1 represents a burnt tree. It simulates an empty forest,
based on user defined probability trees growth, based on user defined proability a fire started, and the expansion of it if there are trees near. Thouse 4 steps 
mean an entire season. User can simulate the state of the forest season to season, the number of total trees season to season.
difusion.py contains a difussion simulation, in wich a matrix represents a container, each 0 represents only solvent, each whole number grater than 0 represents 
the quantity of particles of solute diluted at that space grid. It also has some other conteiner examples in wich an obstacle can be added in the center,
or even wherever user wants. If user sets the number of simulation time steps, user can have the state of the system in that particular time step. If user 
wants a certain number of simulations with T time steps, it can be done. It includes a visualization function, and a video maker function 
if a video of simulations is needed.
diezmil.py contains a simulation of a simple example of dice game called diezmil. User can simulate some games, and the quantity of runds needed to finish 
a certain game.
